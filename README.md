Steadfast Man Coaching Website
This repository contains all the files for the Steadfast Man Coaching website, designed for deployment on Netlify.

About the Project
This website is for a faith-based life coaching business targeting Christian men. The goal is to provide a strong, trustworthy, and compelling online presence that clearly communicates the mission and services of Steadfast Man Coaching.

File Structure
The project is organized into the following files and folders:

index.html: The home page.

about.html: The about page with the coach's story and philosophy.

coaching.html: The services page detailing the coaching packages.

contact.html: The contact page with a form and scheduling information.

assets/: A directory containing all static assets.

css/styles.css: The main stylesheet for the website.

js/script.js: JavaScript for interactive elements like the mobile menu.

images/: A folder for all website imagery. (Note: Images are placeholders and should be replaced with actual high-quality photos).

Deployment on Netlify
This site is ready to be deployed on Netlify.

Push to GitHub: Make sure all the files in this folder are pushed to your GitHub repository.

Connect to Netlify:

Log in to your Netlify account.

Click "New site from Git".

Choose GitHub and authorize access.

Select the repository for this website.

Configure Build Settings:

Branch to deploy: main (or your primary branch).

Customization
Images
The images in the assets/images/ folder are placeholders. To customize the site, replace them with your own professional photos. The recommended images are:

hero-background.jpg: A powerful landscape, like a mountain range at sunrise.

coach-nick.jpg: A professional and approachable headshot or photo of the coach.

bible-on-table.jpg: A lifestyle shot, like a well-worn Bible on a wooden table.

mountain-sunrise.jpg: Another strong landscape for page headers.

blacksmith-tools.jpg: Symbolic imagery like craftsman's tools.

Contact Form
The contact form in contact.html is currently a front-end-only form. To make it functional on Netlify, you need to add the data-netlify="true" attribute to the <form> tag.

Example:
<form id="contact-form" name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">

You will also need to add a hidden input field to the form:
<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />

Netlify will then automatically handle form submissions. You can view submissions in your Netlify site dashboard.

Scheduling Tool
On the contact.html page, there is a placeholder for a Calendly widget. To integrate your own scheduler:

Go to your Calendly account and get the embed code for your event.

Replace the div.calendly-placeholder content with the code provided by Calendly.

Email Marketing Integration
To integrate with an email marketing service, you can use Netlify's built-in form handling to trigger a Netlify Function via a submission-created event. This function can then send the subscriber's information to your email marketing provider's API (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit).
