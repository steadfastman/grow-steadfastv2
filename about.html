                <h2>My Story: From Burnout to a Biblical Foundation</h2>
                <p>For years, I chased the world's definition of success. I climbed the corporate ladder, provided for my family, and checked all the right boxes. But on the inside, I was burned out, disconnected from my wife and kids, and spiritually adrift. I knew God had called me to be a leader, but I was leading from an empty tank, relying on my own strength.</p>
                <p>The turning point came during a period of intense personal struggle. Stripped of my self-reliance, I was forced to my knees. It was there, in the quiet moments with God's Word, that I began to understand what true, biblical manhood looked like. It wasn't about being the loudest voice in the room, but the strongest foundation. It wasn't about dominance, but about servant leadership. Rebuilding my life on the foundation of Scripture transformed my marriage, my fatherhood, and my purpose. Steadfast Man Coaching was born from that transformation, with a mission to guide other men out of the fog and into a life of firm, purposeful, Christ-centered leadership.</p>

                <h2>What is a Steadfast Man?</h2>
                <p>A steadfast man is not perfect, but he is anchored. He rejects passivity and accepts responsibility. He leads with courage, loves sacrificially, and builds a legacy that honors God. His strength isn't found in his own abilities, but in his unwavering commitment to the truth of God's Word.</p>
                <p class="scripture">"Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love." - 1 Corinthians 16:13-14</p>
